 # Caesar Cipher Tool

A simple web-based Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption tool built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


 # Project Description

This project allows users to **encrypt** and **decrypt** text using the **Caesar Cipher** algorithm by entering a message and a shift value. It is fully functional in the browser, requires no downloads or installation, and is great for learning about classical cryptography techniques.


# What is Caesar Cipher?

The **Caesar Cipher** is one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques. It works by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number (called the "shift key"). For example, with a shift of 3:
- `A` becomes `D`
- `B` becomes `E`
- `Z` becomes `C`

This method can be used for both encryption and decryption by shifting forward or backward.

 # Features

- Encrypt any plain text using a Caesar shift
- Decrypt encrypted text back to original
- User-friendly interface
- Works with both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Keeps non-alphabetic characters unchanged
- Fully responsive design

# Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure
- **CSS3** – Styling
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Logic and interactivity
